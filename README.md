# Economics Thesis — Optimal Penalty Decision

This repository contains the working materials for my Economics Capstone thesis at Trinity College Dublin (2025–26).

The project develops a quantitative decision framework for evaluating penalty choices in rugby union using probabilistic modelling and simulation.

## Repository Contents

The repository currently includes:

- **Thesis Proposal**  
  The formal research proposal outlining the motivation, research questions, methodology, and planned contribution.

- **Kick-at-Goal Probability Model**  
  A statistical model estimating the probability of a successful goal kick as a function of contextual variables (e.g. distance, angle, environmental conditions, and player effects).

- **Promotion & Relegation Probability Model**  
  A season-level simulation framework estimating promotion and relegation probabilities under different league states and match outcomes.

## Status

Active development. Models and documentation are being refined as the thesis progresses.

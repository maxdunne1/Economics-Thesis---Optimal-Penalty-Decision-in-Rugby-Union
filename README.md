# Economics Thesis — Optimal Penalty Decision

This repository contains the code, models, and analysis for my Economics Capstone thesis at Trinity College Dublin (2025–26). The project builds a decision framework for *optimal penalty choices* in rugby union (e.g., kick for goal vs kick to touch vs tap), using statistical models and simulation.

## What’s in here

- Data cleaning + feature engineering notebooks
- Probability models for key events (e.g., goal-kicking, kick-to-touch outcomes, attacking-phase outcomes)
- Simulation tools to convert match context into expected outcomes
- Visualisations and exports used in the write-up / presentation

## How to run

1. Create/activate a Python environment (3.11+ recommended)
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
